Demo:         Snowflake Evaluation - ML and Predictive Analytics Setup
Create Date:  2025-06-15
Purpose:      Setup environment for HR employee attrition analysis and machine learning workflows
Data Source:  HR_ANALYTICS.ML_MODELING.HR_EMPLOYEE_ATTRITION
Customer:     Human Resources Analytics and Predictive Modeling
****************************************************************************************************

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script sets up the environment for HR analytics and machine learning workflows.
It configures Git integration for accessing datasets, creates the necessary database
schema, loads HR employee attrition data, and prepares Snowflake notebooks and
Streamlit applications for ML model development and deployment.

Key Concepts:
  • Git Integration: Native Git repository connectivity for data and code access
  • File Formats: CSV parsing configuration for HR datasets
  • Data Loading: Bulk data ingestion from external repositories
  • Snowflake Notebooks: Integrated development environment for ML workflows
  • Streamlit Applications: Interactive dashboards for ML model insights
